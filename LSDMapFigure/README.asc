= This is an object-based plotting library for raster plotting

The objects in this folder are similar to Declan's MapArtist objects but are slightly differnet mainly because I (SMM) couldn't get Declan's thing to do what I wanted. 

Until we write proper documentation, the best way to see how it works is to go down a folder level (into https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[the main LSDMappingTools repo]) and look at the functions that call these objects. 

They are:
